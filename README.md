This is a fun app that uses the giphy API to generate gifs for the user. The user can either select a pre-defined theme or input their own. When the button with that theme is clicked, gifs are rendered. The gifs show up originally as stills but when the image is clicked, the image becomes animated. It will "pause" if clicked again.
